 wire framed the final product, and worked on creating an mvp through psuedocode on a small scale. Then one when box worked I scaled up to a row and then to a column. After the values were recieved I worked on evauluating those values with if statements to produce alert boxes for wins and losses. I later replaced those alert boxes with some more styles but at this point the MVP was reached. I then styled the page until it looked ridiculous...

 one large unsolved problem, if you use the select menu 9 times....regardless of whether there is a winner or not a cats game will be declared and the board reset.
